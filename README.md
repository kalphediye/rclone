Rclone
======

[![Logo](http://rclone.org/img/rclone-120x120.png)](http://rclone.org/)

Rclone is a command line program to sync files and directories to and from

  * Google Drive
  * Amazon S3
  * Openstack Swift / Rackspace cloud files / Memset Memstore
  * Dropbox
  * Google Cloud Storage
  * The local filesystem

Features

  * MD5SUMs checked at all times for file integrity
  * Timestamps preserved on files
  * Partial syncs supported on a whole file basis
  * Copy mode to just copy new/changed files
  * Sync mode to make a directory identical
  * Check mode to check all MD5SUMs
  * Can sync to and from network, eg two different Drive accounts

See the Home page for more documentation and configuration walkthroughs.

Install
-------

Rclone is a Go program and comes as a single binary file.

Download the binary for your OS from

  * http://rclone.org/downloads/

Or alternatively if you have Go installed use

    go install github.com/ncw/rclone

and this will build the binary in `$GOPATH/bin`.

Configure
---------

First you'll need to configure rclone.  As the object storage systems
have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file
`.rclone.conf` in your home directory by default.  (You can use the
`--config` option to choose a different config file.)

The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option, Eg

    rclone config

Usage
-----

Rclone syncs a directory tree from local to remote.

Its basic syntax is

    Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>

See below for how to specify the source and destination paths.

Subcommands
-----------

    rclone copy source:path dest:path

Copy the source to the destination.  Doesn't transfer
unchanged files, testing by size and modification time or
MD5SUM.  Doesn't delete files from the destination.

    rclone sync source:path dest:path

Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination
only.  Doesn't transfer unchanged files, testing by size and
modification time or MD5SUM.  Destination is updated to match
source, including deleting files if necessary.  Since this can
cause data loss, test first with the `--dry-run` flag.

    rclone ls [remote:path]

List all the objects in the the path with size and path.

    rclone lsd [remote:path]

List all directories/containers/buckets in the the path.

    rclone lsl [remote:path]

List all the objects in the the path with modification time,
size and path.

    rclone md5sum [remote:path]

Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.  This
is in the same format as the standard md5sum tool produces.

    rclone mkdir remote:path

Make the path if it doesn't already exist

    rclone rmdir remote:path

Remove the path.  Note that you can't remove a path with
objects in it, use purge for that.

    rclone purge remote:path

Remove the path and all of its contents.

    rclone check source:path dest:path

Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It
compares sizes and MD5SUMs and prints a report of files which
don't match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

    rclone config

Enter an interactive configuration session.

    rclone help

This help.

General options:

```
      --bwlimit=0: Bandwidth limit in kBytes/s, or use suffix k|M|G

      -c, --checksum=false: Skip based on checksum, not mod-time & size
      --config="~/.rclone.conf": Config file.
      --contimeout=1m0s: Connect timeout
  -n, --dry-run=false: Do a trial run with no permanent changes

      --transfers=4: Number of file transfers to run in parallel.
  -v, --verbose=false: Print lots more stuff
  -V, --version=false: Print the version number
```

Developer options:

```
      --cpuprofile="": Write cpu profile to file
```

Local Filesystem
----------------

Paths are specified as normal filesystem paths, so

    rclone sync /home/source /tmp/destination

Will sync `/home/source` to `/tmp/destination`

Swift / Rackspace cloudfiles / Memset Memstore
----------------------------------------------

Paths are specified as remote:container (or remote: for the `lsd`
command.)  You may put subdirectories in too, eg
`remote:container/path/to/dir`.

So to copy a local directory to a swift container called backup:

    rclone sync /home/source swift:backup

For more help see the [online docs on Openstack Swift](http://rclone.org/swift).

Amazon S3
---------

Paths are specified as remote:bucket.  You may put subdirectories in
too, eg `remote:bucket/path/to/dir`.

So to copy a local directory to a s3 container called backup

    rclone sync /home/source s3:backup

For more help see the [online docs on Amazon S3](http://rclone.org/s3).

Google drive
------------

Paths are specified as remote:path  Drive paths may be as deep as required.

The initial setup for drive involves getting a token from Google drive
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

For more help see the [online docs on Google Drive](http://rclone.org/drive).

Dropbox
-------

Paths are specified as remote:path  Dropbox paths may be as deep as required.

The initial setup for dropbox involves getting a token from Dropbox
which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config` walks you
through it.

To copy a local directory to a drive directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source dropbox:backup

For more help see the [online docs on Dropbox](http://rclone.org/dropbox).

Google Cloud Storage
--------------------

Paths are specified as remote:path Google Cloud Storage paths may be
as deep as required.

The initial setup for Google Cloud Storage involves getting a token
from Google which you need to do in your browser.  `rclone config`
walks you through it.

To copy a local directory to a google cloud storage directory called backup

    rclone copy /home/source remote:backup

For more help see the [online docs on Google Cloud Storage](http://rclone.org/googlecloudstorage/).

Single file copies
------------------

Rclone can copy single files

    rclone src:path/to/file dst:path/dir

Or

    rclone src:path/to/file dst:path/to/file

Note that you can't rename the file if you are copying from one file to another.

COPYING file included in this package).
