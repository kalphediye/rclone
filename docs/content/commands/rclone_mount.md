## rclone mount

Mount the remote as a mountpoint. **EXPERIMENTAL**

### Synopsis



rclone mount allows Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Windows to
mount any of Rclone's cloud storage systems as a file system with
FUSE.

This is **EXPERIMENTAL** - use with care.

First set up your remote using `rclone config`.  Check it works with `rclone ls` etc.

You can either run mount in foreground mode or background(daemon) mode. Mount runs in
foreground mode by default, use the `--daemon` flag to specify background mode mode.
Background mode is only supported on Linux and OSX, you can only run mount in
foreground mode on Windows.

Start the mount like this

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files /path/to/local/mount

Or on Windows like this where X: is an unused drive letter

    rclone mount remote:path/to/files X:

When running in background mode the user will have to stop the mount manually (specified below).

When the program ends while in foreground mode, either via Ctrl+C or receiving
a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the mount is automatically stopped.

The umount operation can fail, for example when the mountpoint is busy.
When that happens, it is the user's responsibility to stop the mount manually.

Stopping the mount manually:
    # Linux
    fusermount -u /path/to/local/mount
    # OS X
    umount /path/to/local/mount

### Installing on Windows ###

To run rclone mount on Windows, you will need to
download and install [WinFsp](http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/).

WinFsp is an [open source](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp)
Windows File System Proxy which makes it easy to write user space file
systems for Windows.  It provides a FUSE emulation layer which rclone
uses combination with
[cgofuse](https://github.com/billziss-gh/cgofuse).  Both of these
packages are by Bill Zissimopoulos who was very helpful during the
implementation of rclone mount for Windows.

#### Windows caveats ####

Note that drives created as Administrator are not visible by other
accounts (including the account that was elevated as
Administrator). So if you start a Windows drive from an Administrative
Command Prompt and then try to access the same drive from Explorer
(which does not run as Administrator), you will not be able to see the
new drive.

The easiest way around this is to start the drive from a normal
command prompt. It is also possible to start a drive from the SYSTEM
account (using [the WinFsp.Launcher
infrastructure](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp/wiki/WinFsp-Service-Architecture))
which creates drives accessible for everyone on the system.

### Limitations ###

This can only write files seqentially, it can only seek when reading.
This means that many applications won't work with their files on an
rclone mount.

The bucket based remotes (eg Swift, S3, Google Compute Storage, B2,
Hubic) won't work from the root - you will need to specify a bucket,
or a path within the bucket.  So `swift:` won't work whereas
`swift:bucket` will as will `swift:bucket/path`.
None of these support the concept of directories, so empty
directories will have a tendency to disappear once they fall out of
the directory cache.

Only supported on Linux, FreeBSD, OS X and Windows at the moment.

### rclone mount vs rclone sync/copy ##

File systems expect things to be 100% reliable, whereas cloud storage
systems are a long way from 100% reliable. The rclone sync/copy
commands cope with this with lots of retries.  However rclone mount
can't use retries in the same way without making local copies of the
uploads.  This might happen in the future, but for the moment rclone
mount won't do that, so will be less reliable than the rclone command.

### Filters ###

Note that all the rclone filters can be used to select a subset of the
files to be visible in the mount.

### systemd ###

When running rclone mount as a systemd service, it is possible
to use Type=notify. In this case the service will enter the started state 
after the mountpoint has been successfully set up.
Units having the rclone mount service specified as a requirement
will see all files and folders immediately in this mode.

### Directory Cache ###

Using the `--dir-cache-time` flag, you can set how long a
directory should be considered up to date and not refreshed from the
backend. Changes made locally in the mount may appear immediately or
invalidate the cache. However, changes done on the remote will only
be picked up once the cache expires.

Alternatively, you can send a `SIGHUP` signal to rclone for
it to flush all directory caches, regardless of how old they are.
Assuming only one rclone instance is running, you can reset the cache
like this:

    kill -SIGHUP $(pidof rclone)

### File Caching ###

**NB** File caching is **EXPERIMENTAL** - use with care!

These flags control the VFS file caching options.  The VFS layer is
used by rclone mount to make a cloud storage systm work more like a
normal file system.

You'll need to enable VFS caching if you want, for example, to read
and write simultaneously to a file.  See below for more details.

Note that the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you
may find that you need one or the other or both.

    --vfs-cache-dir string               Directory rclone will use for caching.
    --vfs-cache-max-age duration         Max age of objects in the cache. (default 1h0m0s)
    --vfs-cache-mode string              Cache mode off|minimal|writes|full (default "off")
    --vfs-cache-poll-interval duration   Interval to poll the cache for stale objects. (default 1m0s)

If run with `-vv` rclone will print the location of the file cache.  The
files are stored in the user cache file area which is OS dependent but
can be controlled with `--cache-dir` or setting the appropriate
environment variable.

The cache has 4 different modes selected by `--vfs-cache-mode`.
The higher the cache mode the more compatible rclone becomes at the
cost of using disk space.

Note that files are written back to the remote only when they are
closed so if rclone is quit or dies with open files then these won't
get written back to the remote.  However they will still be in the on
disk cache.

#### --vfs-cache-mode off ####

In this mode the cache will read directly from the remote and write
directly to the remote without caching anything on disk.

This will mean some operations are not possible

  * Files can't be opened for both read AND write
  * Files opened for write can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files open for read with O_TRUNC will be opened write only
  * Files open for write only will behave as if O_TRUNC was supplied
  * Open modes O_APPEND, O_TRUNC are ignored
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

#### --vfs-cache-mode minimal ####

This is very similar to "off" except that files opened for read AND
write will be buffered to disks.  This means that files opened for
write will be a lot more compatible, but uses the minimal disk space.

These operations are not possible

  * Files opened for write only can't be seeked
  * Existing files opened for write must have O_TRUNC set
  * Files opened for write only will ignore O_APPEND, O_TRUNC
  * If an upload fails it can't be retried

#### --vfs-cache-mode writes ####

In this mode files opened for read only are still read directly from
the remote, write only and read/write files are buffered to disk
first.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload fails it will be retried up to --low-level-retries times.

#### --vfs-cache-mode full ####

In this mode all reads and writes are buffered to and from disk.  When
a file is opened for read it will be downloaded in its entirety first.

This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at
the cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching,
including caching directory heirachies and chunks of files.q

In this mode, unlike the others, when a file is written to the disk,
it will be kept on the disk after it is written to the remote.  It
will be purged on a schedule according to `--vfs-cache-max-age`.

This mode should support all normal file system operations.

If an upload or download fails it will be retried up to
--low-level-retries times.
