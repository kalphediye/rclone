Configure
---------

First you'll need to configure rclone.  As the object storage systems
have quite complicated authentication these are kept in a config file
`.rclone.conf` in your home directory by default.  (You can use the
`--config` option to choose a different config file.)

The easiest way to make the config is to run rclone with the config
option:

    rclone config

See the following for detailed instructions for

  * [Google drive](/drive/)
  * [Amazon S3](/s3/)
  * [Swift / Rackspace Cloudfiles / Memset Memstore](/swift/)
  * [Dropbox](/dropbox/)
  * [Google Cloud Storage](/googlecloudstorage/)
  * [Local filesystem](/local/)

Usage
-----

Rclone syncs a directory tree from one storage system to another.

Its syntax is like this

    Syntax: [options] subcommand <parameters> <parameters...>

Source and destination paths are specified by the name you gave the
storage system in the config file then the sub path, eg
"drive:myfolder" to look at "myfolder" in Google drive.

You can define as many storage paths as you like in the config file.

Subcommands
-----------

### rclone copy source:path dest:path ###

Copy the source to the destination.  Doesn't transfer
unchanged files, testing by size and modification time or
MD5SUM.  Doesn't delete files from the destination.

### rclone sync source:path dest:path ###

Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination
only.  Doesn't transfer unchanged files, testing by size and
modification time or MD5SUM.  Destination is updated to match
source, including deleting files if necessary.  Since this can
cause data loss, test first with the `--dry-run` flag.

### rclone ls remote:path ###

List all the objects in the the path with size and path.

### rclone lsd remote:path ###

List all directories/containers/buckets in the the path.

### rclone lsl remote:path ###

List all the objects in the the path with modification time,
size and path.

### rclone md5sum remote:path ###

Produces an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.  This
is in the same format as the standard md5sum tool produces.

### rclone size remote:path ###

Prints the total size of objects in remote:path and the number of
objects.

### rclone mkdir remote:path ###

Make the path if it doesn't already exist

### rclone rmdir remote:path ###

Remove the path.  Note that you can't remove a path with
objects in it, use purge for that.

### rclone purge remote:path ###

Remove the path and all of its contents.

### rclone check source:path dest:path ###

Checks the files in the source and destination match.  It
compares sizes and MD5SUMs and prints a report of files which
don't match.  It doesn't alter the source or destination.

### rclone config ###

Enter an interactive configuration session.

### rclone help ###

Prints help on rclone commands and options.

Server Side Copy
----------------

Drive, S3, Dropbox, Swift and Google Cloud Storage support server side
copy.

This means if you want to copy one folder to another then rclone won't
download all the files and re-upload them; it will instruct the server
to copy them in place.

Eg

    rclone copy s3:oldbucket s3:newbucket

Will copy the contents of `oldbucket` to `newbucket` without
downloading and re-uploading.

Remotes which don't support server side copy (eg local) **will**
download and re-upload in this case.

Server side copies are used with `sync` and `copy` and will be
identified in the log when using the `-v` flag.

Server side copies will only be attempted if the remote names are the
same.

This can be used when scripting to make aged backups efficiently, eg

    rclone sync remote:current-backup remote:previous-backup
    rclone sync /path/to/files remote:current-backup

Options
-------

Rclone has a number of options to control its behaviour.

Options which use TIME use the go time parser.  A duration string is a
possibly signed sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional
fraction and a unit suffix, such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid
time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".

Options which use SIZE use kByte by default.  However a suffix of `k`
for kBytes, `M` for MBytes and `G` for GBytes may be used.  These are
the binary units, eg 2\*\*10, 2\*\*20, 2\*\*30 respectively.

### --bwlimit=SIZE ###

Bandwidth limit in kBytes/s, or use suffix k|M|G.  The default is `0`
which means to not limit bandwidth.

For example to limit bandwidth usage to 10 MBytes/s use `--bwlimit 10M`

This only limits the bandwidth of the data transfer, it doesn't limit
the bandwith of the directory listings etc.

### --checkers=N ###

The number of checkers to run in parallel.  Checkers do the equality
checking of files during a sync.  For some storage systems (eg s3,
swift, dropbox) this can take a significant amount of time so they are
run in parallel.

The default is to run 8 checkers in parallel.

### -c, --checksum ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
MD5SUM and size to determine if files are equal.

This is very useful when transferring between remotes which store the
MD5SUM on the object which include swift, s3, drive, and google cloud
storage.

Eg `rclone --checksum sync s3:/bucket swift:/bucket` would run much
quicker than without the `--checksum` flag.

When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.

### --config=CONFIG_FILE ###

Specify the location of the rclone config file.  Normally this is in
your home directory as a file called `.rclone.conf`.  If you run
`rclone -h` and look at the help for the `--config` option you will
see where the default location is for you.  Use this flag to override
the config location, eg `rclone --config=".myconfig" .config`.

### --contimeout=TIME ###

Set the connection timeout. This should be in go time format which
looks like `5s` for 5 seconds, `10m` for 10 minutes, or `3h30m`.

The connection timeout is the amount of time rclone will wait for a
connection to go through to a remote object storage system.  It is
`1m` by default.

### -n, --dry-run ###

Do a trial run with no permanent changes.  Use this in combination
with the `-v` flag to see what rclone would do without actually doing
it.  Useful when setting up the `sync` command.

### --log-file=FILE ###

Log all of rclone's output to FILE.  This is not active by default.
This can be useful for tracking down problems with syncs in
combination with the `-v` flag.

### --modify-window=TIME ###

When checking whether a file has been modified, this is the maximum
allowed time difference that a file can have and still be considered
equivalent.

The default is `1ns` unless this is overridden by a remote.  For
example OS X only stores modification times to the nearest second so
if you are reading and writing to an OS X filing system this will be
`1s` by default.

This command line flag allows you to override that computed default.

### -q, --quiet ###

Normally rclone outputs stats and a completion message.  If you set
this flag it will make as little output as possible.

### --size-only ###

Normally rclone will look at modification time and size of files to
see if they are equal.  If you set this flag then rclone will check
only the size.

This can be useful transferring files from dropbox which have been
modified by the desktop sync client which doesn't set checksums of
modification times in the same way as rclone.

When using this flag, rclone won't update mtimes of remote files if
they are incorrect as it would normally.

### --ignore-existing ###

Using this option will make rclone unconditionally skip all files
that exist on the destination, no matter the content of these files.

While this isn't a generally recommendable option, it can be useful
in cases where your files change due to encryption. However, it cannot
correct partial transfers in case a transfer was interrupted.

### --stats=TIME ###

Rclone will print stats at regular intervals to show its progress.

This sets the interval.

The default is `1m`. Use 0 to disable.

### --timeout=TIME ###

This sets the IO idle timeout.  If a transfer has started but then
becomes idle for this long it is considered broken and disconnected.

The default is `5m`.  Set to 0 to disable.

### --transfers=N ###

The number of file transfers to run in parallel.  It can sometimes be
useful to set this to a smaller number if the remote is giving a lot
of timeouts or bigger if you have lots of bandwidth and a fast remote.

The default is to run 4 file transfers in parallel.

### -v, --verbose ###

If you set this flag, rclone will become very verbose telling you
about every file it considers and transfers.

Very useful for debugging.

### -V, --version ###

Prints the version number

Developer options
-----------------

These options are useful when developing or debugging rclone.  There
are also some more remote specific options which aren't documented
here which are used for testing.  These start with remote name eg
`--drive-test-option`.

### --cpuprofile=FILE ###

Write cpu profile to file.  This can be analysed with `go tool pprof`.

### --no-check-certificate=true/false ###

`--no-check-certificate` controls whether a client verifies the
server's certificate chain and host name.
If `--no-check-certificate` is true, TLS accepts any certificate
presented by the server and any host name in that certificate.
In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.

This option defaults to `false`.

**This should be used only for testing.**
